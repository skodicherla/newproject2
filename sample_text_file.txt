title is shakespere

O pardon me thou bleeding  piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle awith these butchers
Thou art the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever loved in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb 
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men 
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
And dreadful objects so familiar
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quarter'd by the hands of war
