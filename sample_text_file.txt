title is shakespere

O pardon me thou bleeding  piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle awith these butchers
Thou art the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever loved in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb  mouths do open their ruby lips
And beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men 
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of ITaly
Blodd and destruction shall be so in use
And dreadful objects so familiar
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quarter'd by the hands of war
